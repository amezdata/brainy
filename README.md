# Brainy - AI Chat Application

Brainy is a prototype of a desktop application that provides a chat interface for interacting with AI models through Ollama. It's Designed to run efficiently without relying on expensive hardware or internet connectivity. 

# Important!!
This application was built using PyInstaller, which packages Python scripts into executable files. Some antivirus programs may flag it as a potential threat due to:
1. Heuristic Detection – PyInstaller compresses and bundles files, making it look like malware.
2. Packed Executable – The .exe runs from memory, similar to how some viruses operate.
3. Lack of Code Signing – Unsigned executables are often considered untrusted.

Add the executable to antivirus exclusions if necessary.
